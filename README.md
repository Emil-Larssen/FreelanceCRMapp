# Training project

This project has set out to build a working Freelancer CRM with full GUI and persistence (eventually).\
It is a project to challenge me far beyond my capability (half of the things are completely new to me).
Failure is expected but we'll see how it pans out. \
My goal is to understand the PROCESS of designing a system end to end and expose me to making architectural choices.\
Half the time will be spent making sense of all the first exposures to tools needed to make this thing work out.\

Best case scenario I end up with a good portfolio project after many many iterations.

The CRM app will include means of creating deal offers with tasks, which can then be negotiated and ultimately won or lost.\
Won deals will be converted to a range of subtasks for the deal to be completed, including a function to log time worked on them.\
Upon completion the system will generate an invoice to be sent to the customer and upon payment received, will archive the deal along with its tasks.\
More use cases will be specified as the project moves along.
